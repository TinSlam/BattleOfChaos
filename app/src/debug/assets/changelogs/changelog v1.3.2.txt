Version 1.3.2 changelog :
Added the absolute single best pathfinding algorithm in the whole universe.
Linked the Arena with the Dungeon. You can now unlock new paths in the dungeon by beating some specific levels in the Arena.
Added several signs in the dungeon to provide some information to the player.
Units now need to properly be in front of each other to be considered in melee range.
    This causes some odd behaviours with high movement speeds. Will fix later...
Fixed hp bars not being in sync with the camera.
Fixed selected character's visual effect not being visible to the naked nipple in the training stages.
Fixed numerous rendering frame misses to make the game smoother. This will take a few more patches to be fixed completely.
