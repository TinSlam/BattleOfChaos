Version 1.3.0 changelog :
Added The Dungeon \(^.^)/
Added a Settings state.
Added an alternative way to input commands.
    You may alter between the current two modes in the Settings. Your option will be saved.
Targeting spells like Powershot can now only be canceled by clicking on the same or another spell button.
    This fixed not being able to cancel spells in the training stages.
Literally fixed every single Null Exception error that had the slightest odds of happening.
