Version 1.3.3 changelog :
You may now properly take your party to the dungeon.
Implemented loading screen.
Added a new character selecting method in the dungeon, the mighty dungeon.
    You can now click on a character's portrait to select it.
Improved the algorithm to return an alternative path when no path is found to the target point, SIGNIFICANTLY.
Melee units no longer have an attack range.
    Their attack range is shown as "Melee" in the castle. This visual change requires a progress reset to work.
Fixed the bug where on high movement speeds melee combat was finicky at times.
Fixed a bug where opened paths wouldn't change the clearance value of the corresponding nodes.
    This could result in units not being able to walk past those points.
Fixed a bug where units weren't drawn in the correct order due to a fuck up in a recent patch.
