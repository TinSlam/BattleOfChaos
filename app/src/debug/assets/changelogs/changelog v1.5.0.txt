Version 1.5.0 changelog :
Added a Quest mechanic. You may now have up to 4 active quests simultaneously.
    To complete a quest you need to move up to the npc and accept the quest.
    After completing the requirements you need to go back to the npc and complete the quest to earn rewards.
Added a new quest : Save the village !
    Name : Save the village !
    Description : Defend the village from the raging Trolls. You must kill at least 3 Trolls to complete this quest.
    Rewards : 15 experience, 10 gold, Simple Shield. *Gold and experience are currently not active in the dungeon.*
Added an npc below the lvl 15 path to get the Quest from.
Added a new model for the Knight.
Added an Idle animation. As of now only the Knight has this animation.
Added a visual position indicator for allied units that are not in the view.
Added visual effects for damage/heal values when applied.
Camera repositioning in the dungeon is no longer instant.
    This makes switching characters smoother.
Increased how far allied units can be from the selected character when engaged in a fight without disengaging to follow the selected character.
Non selected units in the dungeon no longer need to be in aggro range to react to an ally being attacked.
    This means they will react accordingly as long as they are not occupied doing a task.
The character is now automatically selected at the beginning of training stages.
Melee units will no longer target an enemy if there isn't enough space to fight.
Fixed NPCs spawning in non walkable terrain. They now properly look for a free space to occupy.
Fixed not being able to cancel the Powershot when clicking on the spell button again.
Fixed a bug where the game would get stuck when a character being followed by other characters dies.
Fixed a few problems with the movement and attack system.
Fixed collision boxes being one frame behind.
